I am an artist based on the career as a Graffiti Writer / Street Artist and mainly use digital media according to the background studied Media Arts. Showing artwork by several ways as like Installation, Objects or on Screen Media etc which has critical or ironical perspectives on subject / medium.

It is especially represented by my early work"SENSELESS DRAWING BOT", which has extracted anonymity and dynamism of the “Tagging” of graffiti. On this work, it has investigated of consideration that humans are not necessarily indispensable existence to this expression and the fundamental essence is just a dynamism in the strokes.

At the series of “SEMI-SENSELESS DRAWING MODULES”, themes are more into focused on modern art. The machines are automatically draw abstract color field drawing according to the behavior that determines by changes of environmental conditions in realtime. Otherwise, machines draws portraits utilize contingency or errors as input realtime as well. Those attempts jsut tries simulate an artist / painter itself.

Thus, the way of realization of the artworks is consistently generative that is showing the all process involved in the formation of it. Because it has the feel more reality than static things and I think it is the reason that people are attracted into artwork. Furthermore, aim to externalize the subject of expression as much as possible. This is to ask and disorder where is the existence about principal of expression and this is most important matter for the art I suppose.
